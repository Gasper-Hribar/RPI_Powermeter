# This is a photo diode calibration file for powermeter app. 
#
# Slices photodiode responsitivity curve into multiple sections for best approximation with polynomial or exponential functions.
# Linear approximation is defined as polynomial.
# For exponential approximation it is expected that equation is comprised of factor before e and it's exponent, which is multiplied by wavelength: eq[0] * e^(eq[1]*wavelength)
# For polynomial approximation it is expected that equation is comprised of factors from x^0 to x^n, where x stands for wavelength: eq[0]*x^0 + eq[1]*x^1 + eq[2]*x^2 + ...
# 
# Sections are defined by wavelength intervals.
# Wavelength interval must be written as 'yyyy-zzzz' for program to work properly.
#
# Access to sections and approximation curves is possible through the name of the photodiode (ps100-6, ps100-7, ...)
